This project emulates a Reddit-style posting that uses jQuery to add dynamically a "SAFE" flag to HTTPS URLs that get added to the forum.  Also, the user can check a box to indicate whether PDF downloads are allowed or not and, if not, a prompt will display, alerting the user to check the "allow PDF downloads" box first.

See app.js for comments.
